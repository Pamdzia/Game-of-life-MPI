# Game-of-life-MPI
During first semester at Master's course one of the tasks was to implement a game of life with some tweaks such as added pollution to the map, with Parallelization using MPI

Main.cpp is written to present how the task was performed by sequential and parallel implementation there are performance variables such as:

MPI Size, Total cells number, used RAM, border size etc.

The goal was to prepare parallelized implementation and updated main, sequential implementation with the rest of the project was prepared by PhD Piotr Oramus
